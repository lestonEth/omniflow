# OmniFlow AI Agent No-Code System

## 🚀 Overview
OmniFlow is a powerful no-code AI agent simulation system that enables users to design, execute, and visualize complex workflows with ease. Using a node-based interface, users can create automated workflows for API calls, condition-based logic, event handling, and memory storage without writing a single line of code.

## 🎯 Features
- **No-Code Workflow Builder** – Drag-and-drop nodes to define AI agent logic.
- **Dynamic Execution** – Real-time processing of nodes and edges.
- **API Integration** – Seamless interaction with external services via API calls.
- **Conditional Logic** – Evaluate expressions dynamically to determine workflow paths.
- **Event Handling** – Trigger actions based on specific events.
- **Memory Nodes** – Store and recall data for decision-making.
- **Visual Debugging** – Monitor execution flow and inspect results interactively.

## 🛠 Installation
To get started with OmniFlow, follow these steps:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/omniflow.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd omniflow

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 Usage
1. **Launch the application** and access the visual workflow editor.
2. **Drag and drop nodes** (Action, Condition, Event, Memory) onto the canvas.
3. **Connect nodes** using edges to define the execution flow.
4. **Configure node parameters**, such as API endpoints, expressions, and conditions.
5. **Run the simulation** and observe real-time execution results.
6. **Optimize and iterate** on your workflow as needed.

## 📌 Node Types
### 1️⃣ Action Node
Performs API calls with customizable HTTP methods, headers, and request bodies.

### 2️⃣ Condition Node
Evaluates expressions dynamically to determine execution paths.

### 3️⃣ Event Node
Triggers workflow execution based on predefined conditions.

### 4️⃣ Memory Node
Stores and retrieves data to maintain state across executions.

## 🔗 API Integration
OmniFlow supports API calls using **fetch()**, allowing seamless integration with external services. Example configuration:

```json
{
  "type": "Action",
  "data": {
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/data",
    "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer token" },
    "body": { "key": "value" }
  }
}
```

## 🚧 Roadmap
- [ ] Enhanced UI/UX for workflow creation
- [ ] Support for custom scripting inside nodes
- [ ] Database integration for persistent storage
- [ ] AI-powered node recommendations
